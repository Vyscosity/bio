# Week 13 — Prokaryotes vs Eukaryotes + Eukaryotic Diversity (need-to-know)

This checklist is derived from what the professor emphasized in the Week 13 transcript.

## Big-picture map (she cares that you can say this clearly)
- **Three domains**: **Bacteria**, **Archaea**, **Eukarya**.
- **Bacteria + Archaea** are **prokaryotic** and **single-celled**.
- **Eukarya** contains the organisms with **eukaryotic cells**; that cellular complexity enables **multicellularity**.

## Prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cells (comparison points)
Know these core contrasts:
- Prokaryotes: **cell membrane, DNA, ribosomes**, but **no membrane-bound internal organelles**.
- Prokaryotic DNA is in the **cytoplasm** (not enclosed in a nucleus).
- Prokaryotes divide by **binary fission** (eukaryotes divide by **mitosis/meiosis**).
- Prokaryotes are **small** (virus comparison mentioned; virus not a cell/not alive by full definition).

## Earliest evidence
- Earliest life: at least **~3.0–3.5 billion years ago**.
- **Stromatolites**: bacterial mats that secrete **calcium carbonate** → fossilize well.

## Prokaryote structures / vocabulary she actually calls out
- **Flagella**: movement (some species).
- **Capsule**: sticky protection/adhesion; why soap + water matter.
- **Pili (singular pilus)**: allow DNA transfer between cells.

## How prokaryotes get genetic diversity (since no sexual reproduction)
She frames this as a likely exam question.
- **Conjugation**: DNA transfer via a pilus (“little straw”).
- **Uptake of DNA from environment** (neighbor dies → DNA available).
- **DNA from viruses** (virus-mediated gene transfer).
- **High mutation rates**.

## Energy strategies (HIGH priority vocabulary)
She explicitly says “I do want you to know this vocabulary.”

### Autotroph vs heterotroph
- **Autotroph**: makes its own food.
- **Heterotroph**: must eat/consume organic matter from others.

### Photoautotroph vs chemoautotroph
- **Photoautotroph**: uses **sunlight** to make food (photosynthesis).
- **Chemoautotroph**: uses **chemicals** in environment to make food (**chemosynthesis**).

### Heterotroph subtypes she names
- **Decomposer**: breaks down dead organic matter.
- **Pathogen**: disease-causing (still heterotrophic).
- **Consumer**: heterotroph that eats living/once-living organisms (you).

### Microbiome (gut flora)
- She emphasizes not all bacteria are “bad actors.”
- **Microbiome**: community of gut organisms; linked to digestion, immunity, vitamins, and broader health.

## Bacteria vs Archaea (what to remember)
- **Archaea** often live in **extreme environments** → “extremophiles” idea.
- Bacteria and archaea were split after studying **biochemistry** (cell wall/membrane and other cellular chemistry).
- She says you **do not** have to memorize the comparison chart; take-home is **they’re chemically different** and archaea may be closer to eukarya in some traits.

## Endosymbiosis (core story)
You need the storyline, not every detail.
- **Mitochondria** originated from a **bacterium** taken into a host cell.
- **Chloroplasts** originated from **cyanobacteria** taken into a host cell.
- Evidence points she states:
  - They have **their own DNA**.
  - They **divide by fission**.
  - They have **their own ribosomes**.

## Eukaryotic diversity (outside plants/animals/fungi): “Here’s what you need to know” list
She explicitly lists the groups.

### Protozoans
- **Single-celled**, **heterotrophic**, **eukaryotic**.
- Examples/ideas:
  - **Giardia**: parasite/pathogen (stream water warning).
  - **Amoebas**: move via **pseudopods**.
  - Some move via **cilia** or **flagella**.

### Algae (broad term)
- **Eukaryotic + photosynthetic + not a plant**.
- **Phytoplankton** = **single-celled, photosynthetic, eukaryotic**.
- **Macroalgae/seaweeds** = multicellular algae (often marine).

#### Green algae (closest to plants)
- Same photosynthetic pigments as plants.
- Store food as **starch**.
- Cell wall made of **cellulose**.

#### Brown algae + diatoms (paired on purpose)
- Closely related; share pigments (chlorophyll a + c mentioned) and store food as **oils/fats**.
- **Kelp** is brown algae (know kelp is brown algae).
- Kelp parts she names: **holdfast**, **stipe**, **air bladders**, **blades**.
- **Diatoms**: **single-celled** phytoplankton with **glass shell**.

#### Red algae
- Pigments: **phycobilins** (plus chlorophyll a + d mentioned).
- Store food as **Floridean starch**.
- Cell walls include **agar** and **carrageenan** (important products; sushi wrap is red algae).

#### Dinoflagellates
- Single-celled, with **flagella**.
- Have **cellulose plates**.
- Can be **bioluminescent**.
- Blooms: “red tide” is a misnomer; better concept is **algal bloom** (sometimes toxic).

### Slime molds
- Eukaryotic decomposers that **eat bacteria** (part of decomposition chain).
- Not fungi (separate branch), but “mold-like” in some traits.
- Can switch between single-celled and multicellular phases.

## Quick self-check (if you can answer these, you’re aligned)
- Define: autotroph, heterotroph, photoautotroph, chemoautotroph, decomposer, pathogen, microbiome.
- Explain how prokaryotes get genetic diversity without sex (4 mechanisms).
- Tell the endosymbiosis story for mitochondria + chloroplasts and give evidence.
- Identify algae groups and 1–2 distinguishing traits for each (green, brown, red, diatoms, dinoflagellates).
