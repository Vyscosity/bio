# Week 17 — Ecology (need-to-know)

This is built from the ecology lecture transcript and sticks to what the professor emphasized.

## Ecology vs environmentalism (she explicitly distinguishes)
- **Ecology**: scientific study of interactions between organisms and environment.
- **Environmentalism**: political/social movement to protect the environment.

## Levels of organization she focuses on
- **Population**: same species in an area.
- **Community**: multiple species interacting.
- **Ecosystem**: community + **abiotic** (nonliving) factors (water, energy, nutrients, etc.).

## Population ecology (single-species dynamics)
### Dispersion patterns
- **Random**
- **Uniform**
- **Clumped** (often driven by resources)

### Growth models (know the shapes and the reason)
- **Exponential growth**: **J-shaped** curve (rapid doubling; bacteria example).
- **Logistic growth**: **S-shaped** curve.
  - Growth slows due to limiting factors.
  - Levels off at **carrying capacity**.

### Carrying capacity
- Definition: maximum population size environment can support given limiting factors (food, space, waste removal, sunlight, etc.).

### Human ecological footprint (conceptual)
- **Ecological footprint**: how much land/resources are required to support a lifestyle.
- She emphasizes reducing footprint by using fewer resources (including **eating less meat**).

## Community ecology (multi-species interactions)
### 1) Competition
- Species compete for resources (light, water, space, prey).

### 2) Predation (includes herbivory)
- Predator-prey “arms race” framing: prey evolve defenses; predators evolve better capture.

### 3) Symbiosis (three categories + examples)
Symbiosis: two species living together; one depends on the relationship.
- **Mutualism** (both benefit):
  - **Acacia + ants** (ants protected in thorns; defend tree; get food).
  - **Lichens** (fungus + algae).
  - **Root nodules**: plant + bacteria (nitrogen fixation → usable nitrogen forms; bacteria get food).
- **Parasitism** (one benefits, host harmed):
  - **Ticks** on humans.
  - Parasitic plant (**dodder**-like example).
  - **Nematode** parasites in mammals.
  - Parasitic isopod on fish.
- **Commensalism** (one benefits; other unaffected):
  - **Barnacles on whales**.
  - **Epiphytes** on tree trunks.

## Ecosystem ecology (energy + nutrient movement)
### Trophic levels vocabulary
- **Producers**: photosynthetic organisms (primary production).
- **Primary consumers**: eat producers.
- **Secondary consumers**: eat primary consumers.
- **Tertiary (and higher) consumers**: top carnivores.
- **Decomposers**: feed on dead organisms from any level; return nutrients.

### Energy flow (one-way) + 10% rule
- Energy enters as **sunlight**, leaves as **heat**.
- At each trophic level, most energy is lost as heat.
- Approximate transfer: **~10%** to the next level; **~90%** lost as heat.
- Implication she emphasizes: you can feed **many more people** on plant calories than on animal calories (less loss when you eat lower on the trophic pyramid).

### Primary productivity (concept)
- Different ecosystems have different productivity.
- She highlights patterns: deserts/tundra low; tropical rainforests, coral reefs, kelp beds high.

### Nutrients cycle (recycle) vs energy (does not)
- **Energy**: flows in one direction (light → heat).
- **Nutrients**: recycle (water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.).

#### Water cycle (key terms)
- **Precipitation**, **runoff**, **evaporation**.
- Plants release water via **transpiration** (plant “sweat”).

#### Carbon cycle + greenhouse effect (conceptual)
- Photosynthesis removes CO₂; respiration releases CO₂.
- Burning fossil fuels releases stored carbon → increased atmospheric CO₂ → greenhouse blanket effect → warming/climate change (she frames it as measurable, with debate focused on policy responses).

#### Nitrogen cycle (one exam-worthy takeaway)
- Plants can’t use atmospheric **N₂** directly.
- Plants primarily use nitrogen as **nitrates**.
- **Bacteria** convert nitrogen into plant-usable forms (soil health matters).

## Disturbance and succession (big concept section)
- **Disturbance**: events like floods, fires, landslides that clear/reset communities.
- **Succession**: sequence of community changes after disturbance.
  - **Primary succession**: starts on bare rock/lava (no soil).
  - **Secondary succession**: starts where soil remains (e.g., after fire).
- **Climax community**: later-stage, more stable community reached if undisturbed.

## Keystone predator/species (concept)
- A **keystone species** prevents one species from taking over, maintaining community diversity.
- Example she gives: predator keeps **urchins** down → protects **kelp forest** diversity; remove predator → urchins overgraze kelp.

## Quick self-check (ecology)
- Explain exponential vs logistic growth and define carrying capacity.
- Define: producer, primary consumer, decomposer, trophic level.
- State the ~10% rule and why eating lower on the pyramid reduces footprint.
- Distinguish energy flow vs nutrient cycling.
- Define and give examples of mutualism/parasitism/commensalism.
- Distinguish primary vs secondary succession.
