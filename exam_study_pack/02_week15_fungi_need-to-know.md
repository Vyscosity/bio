# Week 15 — Kingdom Fungi (need-to-know)

This is derived from what the professor emphasized in the fungi lecture transcript.

## Core identity (she repeats these)
- Fungi are **eukaryotic**.
- Fungi are **heterotrophic** (she says it twice): **do not photosynthesize**.
- Many fungi are **decomposers** (very important ecosystem role).

## How fungi feed (conceptual + vocab)
- Animals: **internal digestion**.
- Fungi: **external digestion** → secrete enzymes onto food, **liquefy**, then absorb nutrients.
- Vocabulary she flags as missing in her earlier slide: **saprophytic**
  - **Saprophytic** = externally digesting dead organic matter and absorbing nutrients (how many decomposer fungi feed).

## Cell wall / membranes (what to remember)
- Fungi have **cell walls**.
- Fungal cell walls are made of **chitin** (key ID trait).
- Membrane includes **ergosterol** (she explicitly says: not a memorize word).

## Growth form vocabulary
- **Hypha** (singular) / **hyphae** (plural): long, thin fungal filaments.
- **Mycelium**: the entire body/network of hyphae.
- Visible “mushrooms/toadstools” = **fruiting body** (reproductive structure).

## Dispersal & reproduction (high-testable)
- Primary dispersal: **spores**.
- Fungi can reproduce **asexually** (clonal spores).
- Sexual reproduction is unusual:
  - Hyphae **fuse**.
  - Often nuclei do **not** fuse immediately → cells can contain **two different nuclei**.
  - Term: **heterokaryotic** (“different nuclei”).
  - Later: nuclei fuse → diploid stage → **meiosis** produces **haploid spores**.

## Symbiosis (she explicitly teaches the three types)
**Symbiosis**: two species living together; one depends on the relationship.
- **Mutualism**: both benefit.
- **Parasitism**: one benefits; the host is harmed.
- **Commensalism**: one benefits; the other is neither helped nor harmed.

### Two fungal mutualisms she wants you to know
- **Lichens**: mutualism between **fungus + algae** (or cyanobacteria).
  - Fungus provides structure/house + nutrients; algae provides food via photosynthesis.
- **Mycorrhizae**: mutualism between **fungus + plant roots**.
  - Fungus increases water/nutrient uptake surface area; helps plant communication; plant provides sugars.

## Pathogenic fungi examples (know the concept)
- **Yeast infections** in humans = fungal parasite/pathogen.
- Plant examples mentioned:
  - **Powdery mildew** on garden plants.
  - **Corn smut (huitlacoche)** as an example of fungal infection (also eaten as a delicacy).

## “Nice-to-know” examples she mentions (don’t memorize taxonomy)
She shows chytrids/zygomycetes/ascomycetes/basidiomycetes images for flavor.
- You are **not** required to memorize the classification chart.
- But she does connect:
  - **Yeast** used in fermentation.
  - **Penicillin** comes from a fungus (she corrects herself: penicillin is an ascomycete).
  - Many human uses: cheese, medicines, dyes, etc.

## Quick self-check (fungi)
- Explain external digestion vs animals.
- Define: chitin, hyphae, mycelium, spores, fruiting body, saprophytic, heterokaryotic.
- Name and explain lichens + mycorrhizae.
- Correctly classify fungi as heterotrophic decomposers (with parasite/mutualist exceptions).
