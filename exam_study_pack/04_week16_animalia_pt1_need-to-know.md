# Week 16 — Kingdom Animalia (Part 1) (need-to-know)

Note: A newer cumulative Animalia guide that includes Part 2 + slides + study guide is available at `exam_study_pack/04_week16_animalia_need-to-know.md`.

Important: the provided transcript is **Animalia Part 1 only** (it stops after nematodes and says the remaining phyla are in the next video). This doc covers what’s in Part 1.

## Kingdom Animalia: baseline traits
- Animals are **eukaryotic** and **multicellular**.
- Animals are **heterotrophic** with **internal digestion** (contrast to fungi external digestion).
- Animals **do not have cell walls**.
- Most animals are **motile** (movement is a key theme).

## Embryology milestone she emphasizes
- Early development stages:
  - **Zygote** divides → **blastula/blastocyst** (hollow ball).
  - **Gastrulation**: one side pushes in → **gastrula**.
  - This forms the beginning of the **digestive cavity**.
- Big division she mentions:
  - In some groups, first opening becomes the **mouth**.
  - In others (including our group), first opening becomes the **anus** and the mouth forms later.

## You need to know the “9 phyla” list exists
She says the course focuses on **nine common phyla** (out of ~32–35 possible depending on classification).

In this Part 1 lecture, she covers (in order):
1) Porifera
2) Cnidaria
3) Platyhelminthes (flatworms)
4) Nematodes (roundworms)

## Key evolutionary “milestones” she uses while moving through phyla
- No digestive cavity (sponges) → **gastrovascular cavity** (cnidarians/flatworms) → **alimentary canal** (roundworms and beyond).
- **Radial symmetry** (cnidarians) → **bilateral symmetry + head region** (flatworms and beyond).

## 1) Phylum Porifera — sponges
Core idea: extremely simple animals; filter-feeding.

Need-to-know structures/terms:
- **Pores**: small openings that draw water in.
- **Osculum**: large opening where water exits.
- **Collar cells**: have **flagella** to drive water current; collar captures food.
- **Filter feeder**: feeds by filtering particles from water.
- **Spicules**: structural support elements (can be glass or calcium; sometimes softer protein in bath sponges).

Other points she makes:
- No real organs (no digestive/circulatory/nervous system).
- Division of labor among cells is why they count as multicellular.

## 2) Phylum Cnidaria — jellyfish/anemones/corals
Two body forms (explicitly tested vibe):
- **Medusa**: tentacles point **down** (jellyfish form).
- **Polyp**: tentacles point **up** (anemones/corals).

Need-to-know traits/terms:
- **Radial symmetry** (top/bottom, no front/back).
- **Gastrovascular cavity**: one opening; digestion and distribution.
- **Mouth only** (no anus): wastes expelled through mouth.
- **Cnidocytes**: stinging cells on tentacles (venom varies by species).
- Nerve net exists, but no true brain/ganglia like bilaterians.

Symbiosis point she mentions:
- Some cnidarians have symbiotic algae (e.g., corals; some anemones).

## 3) Phylum Platyhelminthes — flatworms
Need-to-know traits/terms:
- **Bilateral symmetry** begins here in her storyline.
- Early **cephalization** theme: head region with sensory structures.
- Still have a **gastrovascular cavity** (no anus).
- Mouth is on the **belly**, roughly mid-body (not in the head).
- Move by **gliding** on **cilia** on their belly.
- Can have **eyespot(s)** (light-sensitive; directional sensing).

Examples/concepts:
- Marine flatworms can be colorful.
- **Tapeworms** are a flatworm example (parasitic).
- Regeneration is strong (she describes cutting experiments).

## 4) Nematodes — roundworms
Major milestone:
- **Alimentary canal**: digestive tract from **mouth to anus**.
  - Advantage: keep eating while digesting (food moves along the tube).

Need-to-know traits/terms:
- **Cuticle**: protective covering; contributes to movement.
- Often microscopic; “thread-like” idea tied to name.

Examples/concepts:
- Some are parasites (e.g., **pinworms**; roundworms in pork mentioned → cook to safe temps).
- Some are free-living in soil/ocean eating bacteria.

## Quick self-check (Animalia Part 1)
- Define blastula/blastocyst, gastrulation, gastrula.
- Contrast gastrovascular cavity vs alimentary canal.
- Identify which phyla are radial vs bilateral.
- Match each phylum to its defining terms:
  - Porifera: pores, osculum, collar cells, spicules, filter feeder.
  - Cnidaria: cnidocytes, medusa/polyp, radial symmetry, gastrovascular cavity.
  - Platyhelminthes: bilateral symmetry, eyespots, cilia gliding, mouth-only cavity.
  - Nematodes: alimentary canal, cuticle.
