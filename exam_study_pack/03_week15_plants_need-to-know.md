# Week 15 — Kingdom Plants (need-to-know)

This checklist follows the plants lecture transcript and prioritizes the professor’s repeated/emphasized points.

## Core identity of plants
- **Eukaryotic**, **multicellular**.
- **Autotrophic**: make their own food.
- Have **chloroplasts** and do **photosynthesis**.
- **Cell walls made of cellulose**.

## Land-plant adaptations (what algae lacked)
She frames early plant evolution as “coming out of water → solving land problems.”
- **Cuticle**: waxy covering to prevent drying out.
- **Stomata**: openings to exchange gases (take in CO₂, release O₂) while minimizing water loss.
- **Vascular tissue**: moves water/nutrients up stems into leaves; allows plants to be tall/rigid.

## Alternation of generations (HIGHEST priority / “hardest point”)
You need the storyline and vocabulary.

### The two multicellular stages
- **Gametophyte** (haploid, $n$): multicellular stage that produces **gametes** (eggs/sperm).
- **Sporophyte** (diploid, $2n$): multicellular stage that produces **spores**.

### The verbs (processes) in the loop
- Gametophyte ($n$) makes **gametes by mitosis**.
- **Fertilization**: egg + sperm → **zygote** ($2n$).
- Zygote grows (mitosis) into **sporophyte** ($2n$).
- Sporophyte makes **spores by meiosis** (to go $2n \to n$).
- Spores grow (mitosis) into **gametophyte** ($n$).

If you can recite that loop cleanly, you’re set.

## Major plant groups she says you must know
She explicitly says you need to know: **mosses, ferns, pines, flowering plants**, plus their key traits (and she says you’ll need the phylum names; confirm exact phylum labels with your course study guide if it lists them).

### 1) Mosses (Bryophyta / bryophytes)
Need-to-know traits:
- **No vascular tissue** → must stay **small/low**.
- Still do alternation of generations.
- Dispersal: **spores**.
- **Sperm must swim to egg** → requires water around (limitation on land).
- Structure callouts:
  - Lower “leafy” portion: **gametophyte**.
  - Stalk + capsule: **sporophyte**; capsule releases spores.

### 2) Ferns (vascular, spore-dispersing)
Need-to-know traits:
- **Have vascular tissue** → can be big.
- Dispersal: **spores** (not seeds).
- **Sperm still swim to egg**.
- Spore structures: brown spots under fronds are **sori**.
- Alternation: tiny gametophyte (flat) → large sporophyte (fern you recognize).

### 3) Pines (gymnosperms; Pinophyta mentioned)
Need-to-know traits:
- Have **vascular tissue**.
- Have **seeds** and **pollen** (major evolutionary advancement).
- **Gymnosperm** = “naked seed” (seed not enclosed in an ovary/fruit).
- Reproduction structures: **cones**
  - **Male cones** produce pollen.
  - **Female cones** house ovules → seeds develop.
- Big concept: pollen removes the need for sperm to swim through free water.

Why seeds matter (she explains): seed = “space capsule” with baby plant + food supply + protection → better dispersal than a one-celled spore.

### 4) Flowering plants (angiosperms)
Need-to-know traits:
- Have vascular tissue, cuticle/stomata, seeds, pollen.
- Additional features:
  - **Flowers**: attract pollinators.
  - **Fruits**: aid **seed dispersal**.

## Flower anatomy (explicit list)
Classic arrangement she teaches:
- **Sepals**: outermost; protect bud.
- **Petals**: attract pollinators.
- **Stamen** (male part): **filament + anther**.
  - Anther produces spores → male gametophyte (pollen).
- **Pistil** (female part): **stigma + style + ovary**.
  - **Stigma** is sticky (pollen sticks).
  - Inside **ovary** are **ovules** → become **seeds**.
  - **Ovary becomes fruit**.

Key rule she emphasizes:
- Anything with **seeds inside** is botanically a **fruit** (examples: peppers, zucchini, jalapeño, avocado).

## Quick self-check (plants)
- Write the alternation-of-generations loop from memory.
- Explain why vascular tissue mattered for land.
- Contrast spores vs seeds; explain what pollen is (male gametophyte).
- Label a flower: sepals, petals, stamen (filament/anther), pistil (stigma/style/ovary), ovule.
- For each group (moss/fern/pine/flowering plant) give: vascular? dispersal (spore vs seed)? does sperm need water?
