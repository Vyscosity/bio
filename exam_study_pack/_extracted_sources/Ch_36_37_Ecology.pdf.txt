Ecology Concepts
1. Describe the exponential and logistic growth patterns, what creates the patterns and use
examples.
2. Describe the three types of symbiosis using examples for each.
3. Describe the general trophic levels within an ecosystem, how energy moves through it
and how chemicals are recycled. Be sure to use an example for each level.
4. Explain how competition may eliminate a species from a community, and how niche
specificity may allow competitors to coexist.
5. Explain the process of succession in an ecosystem. Use an example.
