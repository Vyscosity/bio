Animalia

Characteristics of the Kingdom Animalia
• Animals are eukaryotic
• multicellular
• They are heterotrophic
• generally digesting food in an internal chamber
• lacking rigid cell walls
• Motile
• embryos pass through a blastula stage.


--- PAGE 3 ---
Embryonic development:
• Sphere of cells is a blastula
• During gastrulation, some cells move inward
• Produces a three-layer embryo


--- PAGE 4 ---
Animal Diversity
• Depending on the authority, the number of phyla described in
Kingdom Animalia is between 32-35.
• We will focus on the 9 most common phyla.


--- PAGE 5 ---
Animal Diversity
• Zoologists split Animals up between those that have a
backbone (vertebrate animals) and those that do not
(invertebrate animals).

animal phyla

Phylum Porifera
Etymology:- From the Latin
porus for pore and Ferre to bear.
• No definite symmetry.
• Few tissues, no organs.
• No true body cavity.
• All are sessile, (live attached to
something as an adult).
• Reproduce sexually or
asexually
• Has no nervous system.
• Has a distinct larval stage
which is planktonic.
• Lives in aquatic environments,
mostly marine.
• All are filter feeders.
• Pull water in pores and out
through an osculum.
• Use collar cells to create a
current and capture food.
• Often have a skeleton of
spicules made of glass, calcium
or protein.

Phylum Cnidaria
Etymology:- From the Greek knide for nettle.
• Radially Symmetrical.
• Few tissues, some organs.
• Gastrovascular cavity (a mouth leading to a
digestive sac).
• Two different forms exist, medusa and polyp
• Reproduction is asexual or sexual.
• Has a simple net like nervous system.
• Has a distinct larval stage which is planktonic.
• Lives in aquatic environments, mostly marine.
• Mostly carnivorous otherwise filter feeders.
• May have a minimal skeleton of chiton or
calcium carbonate.
• Tentacles surrounding the mouth with stinging
cells (cnidocytes)

Phylum Platyhelminthes
Etymology:- From the Greek platy for flat and
helminthes for worms, hence Flat Worms.
