Simple
Single-celled

unprotected DNA

Prokaryotic Cells
Are very diverse and they have impacted the planet’s atmosphere.


--- SLIDE 6 ---
Prokaryotic Cells
Obtain energy in a diverse number of ways:
Some are photoautotrophic
Some are chemoautotrophic
Some are heterotrophic decomposers
Some are heterotrophic pathogens
Some are heterotrophic and mutualistic (microbiome)


--- SLIDE 7 ---
Prokaryotic Cells
Can perform chemosynthesis


--- SLIDE 8 ---
Prokaryotic Cells
Do not have sexual reproduction BUT, they have three ways to obtain genetic diversity:
Conjugation
DNA transferred from donor cell to recipient cell usually through pilus (pleural: pili).
Transformation
Living cell acquires DNA fragments released by dead cells.
Transduction
DNA fragments carried from one cell to another by viruses.


--- SLIDE 9 ---
Domain Bacteria
Includes:
Autotrophic bacteria
Photosynthetic without producing oxygen
Chemosynthetic bacteria - Obtain energy from various compounds or elements through oxidation
Decomposing bacteria
Pathogenic bacteria (strep throat)
Helpful bacteria (microbiome)

--- SLIDE 13 ---
Domain Bacteria
Bacteria are useful to humans:
Other useful bacteria
Human health - Lactobacillus acidophilus
Dairy  - Buttermilk, sour cream, yogurt, cheese
Industrial - Utilizes bacteria waste products


--- SLIDE 14 ---
Domain Archaea
Is diverse


--- SLIDE 15 ---
Domain Archaea
Are similar to Bacteria in that they are prokaryotic but have some significant differences


--- SLIDE 16 ---
Domain Archaea
Include
methanogens (which produce methane gas)
halophiles (salt lovers)
thermophiles (heat lovers)


--- SLIDE 17 ---
Domain Archaea
Methanogens live in anaerobic environments


--- SLIDE 18 ---
Domain Archaea
Halophiles live in very salty environments


--- SLIDE 19 ---
Domain Archaea
Thermophiles thrive in very hot environments


--- SLIDE 20 ---
Endosymbiosis
Evidence suggests that endosymbiosis was key in the evolution of eukaryotes
Endosymbiosis is when one species lives inside another host species. 
Two eukaryotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, appear to have evolved from small, free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by the host cell.

In-folding of the Plasma Membrane
Formed the 
Nucleus
Endoplasmic Reticulum
Golgi Apparatus


--- SLIDE 24 ---
Domain Eukarya
A tentative phylogeny of eukaryotes includes multiple clades of protists


--- SLIDE 26 ---
“Protists” you need to know
Protozoans
Algae

Slime Molds


--- SLIDE 27 ---
Protozoans
Move and obtain nutrients by eating (heterotrophic).
Giardia is an intestinal parasite.
Paramecium move with
hair-like cilia.
Amoeba moves with cytoplasmic streaming and pseudopods.
Euglena move with
flagella.


--- SLIDE 28 ---
Algae
Algae (singular, alga) are photosynthetic protists able to produce their own food (autotrophic)from sunlight.
