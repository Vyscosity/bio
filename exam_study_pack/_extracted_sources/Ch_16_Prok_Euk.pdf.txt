Chapter 16 Study Questions
1. Compare and contrast Archaea and Bacteria. Include cell structure, nutrition and
ecological roles (where they occur and what they do there).
2. Explain the endosymbiotic theory and how it relates to prokaryotes and eukaryotes
today. Explain how it happened and the evidence that supports the theory.
3. Compare and contrast phytoplankton, seaweeds and protozoans. Use examples and
include structure, nutrition and ecological roles (where they occur and what they do
there).
