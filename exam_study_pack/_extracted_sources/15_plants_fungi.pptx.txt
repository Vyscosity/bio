Kingdom Fungi


--- SLIDE 3 ---
Characteristics of the Kingdom Fungi
Cell wall containing chitin
Cell membrane containing ergosterol
Heterotrophic decomposers, some parasites
External digestion, then absorption
Dispersal to new environments using spores (one cell progeny)
Growth of long thin cells called hyphae


--- SLIDE 4 ---
Characteristics of the Kingdom Fungi
Fungi absorb food after digesting it outside their bodies


--- SLIDE 5 ---
Characteristics of the Kingdom Fungi
A fungus usually consists of a mass of threadlike hyphae
Called a mycelium


--- SLIDE 6 ---
Characteristics of the Kingdom Fungi
Fungi produce spores in both asexual and sexual life cycles
In sexual reproduction, 
1 cells fuse, then (often much later resulting in heterokaryotic cells) 
2 nuclei fuse and immediately 
3 meiosis produces haploid spores


--- SLIDE 7 ---
Characteristics of the Kingdom Fungi
Fungal groups have characteristic reproductive structures


--- SLIDE 8 ---
Fungi can be classified into five groups
Chytridiomycota
Zygomycota
Glomeromycota
Ascomycota
Basidiomycota


--- SLIDE 9 ---
Chytridiomycota - The chytrids
Simple, mostly one-celled organisms
Some are parasitic, and other are saprobic.
Cause of amphibian declines worldwide


--- SLIDE 10 ---
Zygomycota
Sexual reproduction by zygospores
Asexual reproduction by sporangia
molds love strawberries


--- SLIDE 11 ---
Zygomycota
Some destroy our food like the common Bread Mold
Some are used for food and other things
Tempeh in Indonesia
Manufacture of birth control pills and anesthetics
Yellow pigment for coloring margarine


--- SLIDE 12 ---
Ascomycota
Food: Morels and truffles
Yeast: Fermentation produces ethyl alcohol - Wines, beers.  CO2 causes bread dough to rise and gives it porous texture.
Cool article on beer brewing yeast


--- SLIDE 13 ---
Ascomycota
Penicillium,  Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Morchella
Ergot fungus may infect rye and other grains. Initial source for the manufacture of LSD
Plant diseases - Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight


--- SLIDE 14 ---
Basidiomycota
Includes mushrooms, toadstools, puffballs, shelf fungi, jelly fungi

Fruiting Bodies

The Importance of Fungi
Fungi have enormous ecological benefits and practical uses- essential decomposers & provide antibiotics and food
Fungi also form mutualistic relationships with animals


--- SLIDE 17 ---
Symbiosis
When two species live together and at least one of them is dependent on the relationship to survive
There are three basic types of symbiosis
Mutualistic: When both parties benefit
Parasitic: When one party benefits and the other is harmed
Commensalistic: When one party benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed.
There are fungal examples of all three


--- SLIDE 18 ---
Lichens: Mutualism
Lichens consist of fungi living mutualistically with photosynthetic organisms (algae or cyanobacteria


--- SLIDE 19 ---
Fungi form mutualistic relationships with plants
This benefits farms and ecological restoration projects
Mycorrhizae: Mutualism


--- SLIDE 20 ---
Smuts
Rusts
Mildews
Huitlacoche
Fungal pathogens: Parasitism

The Diversity of Organisms on this Planet are divided into different Domains


--- SLIDE 23 ---
Characteristics of  Kingdom Plantae
Cell walls containing cellulose
Autotrophic
Chloroplasts with chlorophyll a and b
Multicellular
Cuticle & stomata
Non-mobile
Alternation of Generations


--- SLIDE 24 ---
Kingdom Plantae
Plants evolved from green algae 
Molecular, physical, and chemical evidence indicate that green algae called charophyceans are the closest living relatives of plants


--- SLIDE 25 ---
Kingdom Plantae
Plants have some specific adaptations that are not found in algae


--- SLIDE 26 ---
Kingdom Plantae
Plants have vascular tissue
Which helps distribute nutrients throughout the organism


--- SLIDE 27 ---
Kingdom Plantae
Plants alternate between 2 generations in their life cycle: Alternation of generations


--- SLIDE 28 ---
Kingdom Plantae
Plant diversity reflects the evolutionary history


--- SLIDE 29 ---
Kingdom Plantae
Bryophytes


--- SLIDE 30 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Bryophyta
Bryophytes lack vascular tissue and include
The mosses, hornworts, and liverworts


--- SLIDE 31 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Bryophyta
Mosses have a dominant gametophyte
Which produce eggs and swimming sperm
The zygote develops on the gametophyte into the smaller sporophyte


--- SLIDE 32 ---
Moss life cycle
Second animation of Moss life cycle
Liverwort life cycle
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Bryophyta
Mosses follow the alternation of generations


--- SLIDE 33 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Monilophyta
Ferns are seedless vascular plants 
Are sporophyte dominant
disperse with spores from sori
and have  flagellated sperm


--- SLIDE 34 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Monilophyta
Seedless plants dominated vast “coal forests”
Ferns and other seedless plants once dominated ancient forests
Their remains formed coal


--- SLIDE 35 ---
Ferns come in a variety of shapes and sizes


--- SLIDE 36 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Monilophyta
Ferns follow an alternation of generations


--- SLIDE 37 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Pinophyta
Gymnosperms, such as pines and cycads
Are sporophyte dominant
Produce seeds in cones
Produce pollen in cones
Wind moves pollen from plant to plant at which point the pollen produces a sperm= pollination
Produce woody tissues


--- SLIDE 38 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Pinophyta


--- SLIDE 39 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Pinophyta
Pines follow an alternation of generations


--- SLIDE 40 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Other Gymnosperms
Pinophyta – Pines, etc.
Ginkgophyta-Ginkgo
Cycadophyta- Cycads
Gnetophyta- Ephedra, Welwischia


--- SLIDE 41 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnoliophyta
Also known as Angiosperms
Sporophyte dominant
Produce seeds in an ovary that becomes a fruit
Produce pollen in an anther of a flower
Animals move pollen from flower to flower at which point the pollen produces a sperm = pollination


--- SLIDE 42 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnoliophyta
The flower is the centerpiece of reproduction
Flowers usually consist of sepals, petals, stamens (which produce pollen), and ovaries inside of which ovules (which produce eggs)


--- SLIDE 43 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnoliophyta
The seeds of angiosperms develop within protective ovaries that become fruits


--- SLIDE 44 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnoliophyta
Flowering plants follow an alternation of generations


--- SLIDE 45 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnoliophyta
Ovaries become fruits
Ovules become seeds inside fruits


--- SLIDE 46 ---
Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnoliophyta
The structure of a fruit reflects its function in seed dispersal


--- SLIDE 47 ---
Plants are important in many ways
Some plants in forests can be used in medicinal ways
