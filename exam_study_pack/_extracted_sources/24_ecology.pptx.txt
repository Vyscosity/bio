Ecology focuses on the dynamics at the population and ecosystem levels

Ecology: Population Dynamics
Population ecology is the study of how and why populations change
A population is a group of individuals of a single species that occupy the same general area

Ecology: Population Dynamics
Environmental and social factors influence the spacing of individuals in various dispersion patterns: clumped, uniform, or random

Ecology: Population Dynamics
Populations change over time as a combination of the birth rate and the mortality rate.
Exponential growth is the accelerating increase that occurs when growth is unlimited.  The equation G  rN describes this J-shaped curve
G  the population growth rate
r  an organism’s inherent capacity to reproduce
N  the population size

Ecology: Population Dynamics
Limiting factors are variables that restrict population growth such as limited space, food, water or the ability of the ecosystem to process waste from a population. 

The equation G  rN(K – N)/K describes a logistic growth curve where 
K  carrying capacity

Carrying Capacity is the size of the population that can be sustainably supported by the environment.

An ecological footprint is the impact of a person or community on the environment, expressed as the amount of land required to sustain their use of natural resources.

Symbiosis
A symbiotic relationship is an interaction between two or more species that live together in direct contact

Ecology: Community Dynamics
Symbiosis: mutualism
Association between Acacia and ants:
Ants live in hollow thorns.
Ants feed on sugar, fats and proteins from petiolar nectaries and from special bodies at tips of leaflets.
Ants attack other organisms that come into contact with plant.

Trophic structures can be represented by food chains










Decomposers: fungi and bacteria decompose waste matter and recycle nutrients in ecosystems

Ecology: Ecosystem Dynamics
Energy moves into an ecosystem in the form of sunlight captured by photosynthesizers and out in the form of heat.

Energy supply limits the length of food chains
A pyramid of production shows the flow of energy from producers to primary consumers and to higher trophic levels

Primary production sets the energy budget for ecosystems
Primary production is the rate at which producers convert sunlight to chemical energy in organic matter, or biomass

Ecology: Disturbance
Disturbance is a prominent feature of most communities
Disturbances are events that damage biological communities, remove organisms from them, and alter the availability of resources are characteristic of most communities

Ecology: Succession
Ecological succession
Is a transition in species composition of a community following a disturbance
0


--- SLIDE 31 ---
Ecology: Succession
Primary succession
Is the gradual colonization of barren rocks
Secondary succession
Occurs after a disturbance has destroyed a community but left the soil intact
0


--- SLIDE 32 ---
Ecology: Succession
Primary succession - Involves formation of soil in beginning stages
On bare rocks and lava:
Tiny cracks permit plants to invade.
Fern spores blow into cracks of bare lava


--- SLIDE 33 ---
Ecology: Succession
Primary succession:
On bare rocks and lava:
Lichens and mosses become established on surfaces.
Contribute to organic matter and small amount of soil builds up
Other species become established.
As soil buildup continues, larger plants take over.
Eventually vegetation reaches equilibrium of a stable plant community = climax community. 
Communities can differ in response to available species and chance events.
