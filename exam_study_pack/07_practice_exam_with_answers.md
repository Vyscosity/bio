## Short Answer (sample strong answers)

61) **Protostome**: first embryonic opening becomes the **mouth**. **Deuterostome**: first embryonic opening becomes the **anus** (mouth forms later).

62) 9 common phyla (one key trait each):
- Porifera: pores/osculum; collar cells; spicules; filter feeding
- Cnidaria: cnidocytes; medusa/polyp; radial symmetry
- Platyhelminthes: bilateral symmetry; cephalization; gastrovascular cavity
- Nematoda: cuticle; alimentary canal; cylindrical/tapered
- Mollusca: mantle/foot/gill/radula
- Annelida: segmentation; setae
- Arthropoda: chitin exoskeleton; jointed appendages; molting
- Echinodermata: water vascular system; tube feet; endoskeleton; adult 5-part radial
- Chordata: notochord; dorsal hollow nerve cord; pharyngeal slits; post-anal tail

63) Mollusca definitions (one-liners):
- Mantle: tissue that secretes the shell (in many molluscs)
- Muscular foot: locomotion/attachment structure (e.g., snail “foot”)
- Gill: gas exchange organ for extracting O₂ from water
- Radula: rasping/filing feeding structure used to scrape/grind food

64) Echinoderms: water vascular system is a hydraulic system that moves water through canals; it powers/controls **tube feet** (extension/retraction) used for movement and/or feeding.

65) Chordate features: dorsal hollow nerve cord, notochord, pharyngeal gill slits, post-anal tail. Non-obvious chordate example from lecture: **sea squirt**.

66) Five key transitions (examples): tissues/organs; radial→bilateral + cephalization; gastrovascular cavity→alimentary canal; segmentation; development of specialized structures like gills/exoskeleton/endoskeleton/notochord/vertebrae.

67) **Autotroph** makes its own food (e.g., plants; photoautotrophs). **Heterotroph** gets energy by consuming organic matter from others (e.g., fungi; animals; protozoans).

68) Prokaryote diversity mechanisms:
- **Conjugation** (DNA transfer via pilus)
- **Uptake of DNA from environment**
- **Virus-mediated DNA transfer**
- **High mutation rates**

69) Endosymbiosis: host cell engulfed bacteria → **mitochondria**; engulfed cyanobacteria → **chloroplasts**. Evidence: organelles have **their own DNA**, **divide by fission**, and have **their own ribosomes** (any two).

70) **Phytoplankton**: single-celled, photosynthetic, eukaryotic. **Macroalgae/seaweed**: multicellular photosynthetic eukaryotes that are not plants (often marine).

71)
- Green algae: plant-like pigments; store **starch**; **cellulose** walls (any one).
- Diatoms: single-celled with **glass shell**.
- Red algae: **phycobilins** pigments; **agar/carrageenan**; Floridean starch (any one).
- Dinoflagellates: **flagella**; **cellulose plates**; can be **bioluminescent**; blooms (any one).

72) **Hyphae** are long, thin fungal filaments. **Mycelium** is the full network/body made of hyphae.

73) **Saprophytic**: feeding by externally digesting dead organic matter and absorbing nutrients.

74) Lichen = **fungus + algae** (or cyanobacteria). Fungus provides structure/protection and some nutrients; algae provides food (photosynthate).

75) One correct loop:
- **Gametophyte (n)** makes **gametes** by **mitosis** → **fertilization** → **zygote (2n)** → grows into **sporophyte (2n)** → sporophyte makes **spores (n)** by **meiosis** → spores grow (mitosis) into **gametophyte**.

76)
- Moss: (i) no vascular (ii) spores (iii) sperm must swim (needs water)
- Fern: (i) vascular (ii) spores (iii) sperm must swim
- Pine: (i) vascular (ii) seeds + pollen (iii) sperm do NOT need free water; pollen delivers

77)
A = **Stigma**
B = **Style**
C = **Ovary**
D = **Stamen**

78) Gastrovascular cavity: one opening; digestion + distribution; wastes exit same opening. Alimentary canal: tube with **mouth and anus**, allows continuous feeding/digestion (food moves along; more efficient).

79) Sponge water flow: enters through **pores** and exits through **osculum**.

80) **Medusa**: jellyfish form, tentacles down. **Polyp**: attached form, tentacles up (anemones/corals).

81)
- Population: individuals of **one species** in an area
- Community: **multiple species** interacting
- Ecosystem: community + **abiotic** factors

82) Exponential growth: **J-shaped**, rapid increase. Logistic growth: **S-shaped**, slows and levels. **Carrying capacity**: max population size environment can support.

83) Only ~10% of energy passes up each trophic step; most is lost as heat. Eating lower (more plant-based) wastes fewer trophic transfers, so it uses fewer resources per calorie and lowers footprint.

84) **Primary succession** starts on bare rock/lava without soil. **Secondary succession** starts where soil remains after disturbance (e.g., fire).

85) Keystone species/predator maintains diversity by preventing one species from dominating. Example: predator keeps **urchins** from overpopulating; without predator, urchins overgraze **kelp** and the community collapses in diversity.
