# Week 16 — Kingdom Animalia (cumulative: transcript + slides + study guide)

This document combines:
- Video transcript emphasis (Part 1 + Part 2)
- Lecture slides (Animalia deck)
- Study guide terms/questions (Chapter 18 study guide)

## Core characteristics of Animalia (and contrasts)
**Animals (Animalia)**
- **Eukaryotic**, **multicellular**
- **Heterotrophic** with **internal digestion** (digest in an internal chamber)
- **No rigid cell walls** (contrast: plants/fungi have cell walls)
- Generally **motile**
- Embryos pass through a **blastula** stage

**Contrast**
- Versus **fungi**: fungi are heterotrophs but do **external digestion**; many are saprophytic decomposers.
- Versus **plants**: plants are autotrophic/photosynthetic with cellulose walls.

## Study guide vocab (high-yield)
- **Ingestion**: taking food into the body (animals ingest; fungi generally absorb after external digestion)
- **Blastula / blastocyst**: hollow ball stage early embryo
- **Gastrulation** → **gastrula**: inward movement of cells that begins forming the digestive cavity; produces a 3-layer embryo
- **Radial vs bilateral symmetry**
- **Gastrovascular cavity vs alimentary canal**
- **Protostome vs deuterostome** (first embryonic opening becomes mouth vs anus)
- **Vertebrate vs invertebrate**

## Big “body plan transitions” (study guide asks for 5)
A solid set you can explain (with examples):
1) **No true organs** → true tissues/organs (sponges → most other phyla)
2) **Radial symmetry** → **bilateral symmetry + cephalization** (cnidarians → flatworms and beyond)
3) **Gastrovascular cavity** (one opening) → **alimentary canal** (two openings; mouth→anus)
4) Increased **specialization of organ systems** (nervous/circulatory/respiration)
5) **Segmentation + appendages/skeletons** (annelids segmented; arthropods exoskeleton/jointed legs; echinoderms endoskeleton; chordates notochord/vertebrae)

## Digestive cavity vocabulary (compare)
- **Gastrovascular cavity**: mouth → digestive sac; **one opening**; wastes exit through mouth.
- **Alimentary canal**: **tube** with **mouth and anus**; advantage = continuous feeding while digestion proceeds; later phyla show increasing specialization along the tube.

## Symmetry vocabulary
- **Radial symmetry**: top/bottom; no front/back (cnidarians; adult echinoderms).
- **Bilateral symmetry**: distinct front/back; head end; supports cephalization (flatworms and most later phyla).

## The 9 phyla you’re responsible for
1) Porifera
2) Cnidaria
3) Platyhelminthes
4) Nematoda
5) Mollusca
6) Annelida
7) Arthropoda
8) Echinodermata
9) Chordata

## 1) Porifera (sponges)
Key ideas:
- Very simple animals: **few tissues, no organs**, no nervous system.
- **Sessile** adults; have a **larval planktonic** stage.
- **Filter feeders**.

Must-know terms:
- **Pores**: water enters.
- **Osculum**: water exits.
- **Collar cells**: create water current (flagella) and capture food.
- **Spicules**: skeleton elements (glass/calcium/protein); used for identification.

## 2) Cnidaria (jellyfish, anemones, corals)
Key ideas:
- **Radial symmetry**.
- **Gastrovascular cavity**.
- Two body forms:
  - **Medusa**: tentacles down.
  - **Polyp**: tentacles up.
- Tentacles have **cnidocytes** (stinging cells).
- Simple nerve net; larval stage is planktonic.

## 3) Platyhelminthes (flatworms)
Key ideas:
- **Bilateral symmetry** + early **cephalization**.
- Still have a **gastrovascular cavity** (no anus).
- **Cephalization** + **nerve ganglia** (study guide term).
- Move by gliding using cilia on ventral surface (from transcript).

## 4) Nematoda (roundworms)
Key ideas:
- **Alimentary canal** (mouth → anus) is a major milestone.
- Have a **cuticle**.
- Study guide: body is **cylindrical and tapered at both ends**.
- Can be free-living or parasitic.

## 5) Mollusca (snails, slugs, clams, octopus/squid)
Major milestone emphasized in the video: **gills** (efficient oxygen extraction vs skin diffusion).

Must-know shared characteristics (study guide list):
- **Mantle** (secretes shell in many species)
- **Muscular foot**
- **Gill**
- **Radula**

Also consistent with slides:
- **Bilateral symmetry**
- **Alimentary canal**
- Nervous system; open circulatory system with heart (details shown; don’t memorize every organ)

Representative examples you should be able to name:
- Gastropods: **snails, slugs, limpets, nudibranchs**
- Bivalves: **clams, mussels, scallops** (filter-feeding with siphons)
- Cephalopods: **octopus, squid, cuttlefish, nautilus**

## 6) Annelida (segmented worms)
Must-know traits:
- **Segmentation** (milestone)
- **Setae** = bristles (for traction / feeding structures in some)
- Slides emphasize: true coelom; closed circulatory system; ventral nerve cord + ganglia (don’t over-memorize; the exam focus is segmentation + setae).

Representative examples:
- **Earthworms**
- Marine tube worms (feather duster/Christmas tree worms)

## 7) Arthropoda (insects, spiders, crustaceans)
Key reasons they “win” (transcript theme): enormous species diversity.

Must-know traits:
- **Exoskeleton** made of **chitin**
- **Jointed** appendages/legs
- **Molting** (shed exoskeleton to grow)

Also on slides (useful support):
- Body in 2–3 main sections; open circulatory system; respiratory structures vary (tracheae/spiracles in many terrestrial forms).

Representative examples:
- Insects, spiders/ticks, crabs/shrimp, centipedes/millipedes, barnacles.

## 8) Echinodermata (starfish, urchins, sea cucumbers)
Must-know traits (study guide list):
- **Water vascular system**
- **Tube feet**
- **Endoskeleton** (internal calcareous plates)

Symmetry:
- Adults are **pentamerously radial** (5-part radial).
- Larvae are **bilateral** (transcript “throwback” point).

Representative examples:
- Sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins/sand dollars, sea cucumbers, sea lilies.

## 9) Chordata (our phylum)
Must-know 4 features (study guide list):
- **Dorsal hollow nerve cord**
- **Notochord**
- **Pharyngeal gill slits**
- **Post-anal tail**

Important nuance from transcript:
- Not all chordates are “obviously vertebrate” (e.g., sea squirts).
- Many chordates are **vertebrates** where the notochord is modified into the **vertebral column**.

## Study guide concept practice (directly aligned)
1) Compare a sponge to a lizard:  
- Similarities (examples): both animals, eukaryotic, multicellular, heterotrophic, embryos pass blastula stage (general animal trait).  
- Differences (examples): sponge sessile/no true organs vs lizard motile with complex organs; sponge filter-feeds via pores/osculum vs lizard has mouth→anus alimentary canal; sponge no nervous system vs lizard brain/spinal cord; sponge has spicules vs lizard internal skeleton.

2) Protostome vs deuterostome: be able to state which opening forms first (mouth vs anus) and that it’s tied to gastrulation.
